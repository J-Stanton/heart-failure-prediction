In this repository, you can find our main model inside the [`CODE`](CODE/) folder or by [clicking here](CODE/model.py).

Additionally, the `CODE` folder contains other models that demonstrate parameter tuning, as well as a model with additional evaluation metrics, available [here](CODE/model-graphs.py).

Graphs generated during training and parameter tuning can be found in the [`GRAPHS`](GRAPHS/) folder.

The dataset used for training is [`Heart.csv`](Heart.csv).
